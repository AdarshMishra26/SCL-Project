## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the internship carried out at SCL Mohali. The project aimed to explore the experimental analysis of MOS Capacitors in the context of Oxide Furnaces. The primary tools used for this analysis were CV Plotter Metrology, and the project also involved the identification of fabrication facilities and their respective processes.

## Project Description

The objective of the internship was to gain insights into the behavior of MOS Capacitors under various conditions, especially in the context of Oxide Furnaces. The project involved the following key components:

1. **CV Plotter Metrology:** The project utilized CV Plotter Metrology to obtain capacitance-voltage (CV) plots of MOS Capacitors. This involved experimental analysis to understand the electrical characteristics of the capacitors.

2. **Identification of Fabrication Facilities:** The internship also focused on identifying fabrication facilities and understanding their processes. This included studying the various steps involved in the fabrication of MOS Capacitors and the impact of these steps on the device's performance.
